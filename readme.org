CMSIS will also produce linker warnings due to newlib e.g. "_write is not implemented and will
always fail". Another linker warning will appear too: elf has a LOAD segment with RWX permissions.
There is quite a bit of a size overhead when pulling in all the CMSIS modules. An average project
would be around ~100Mb.
